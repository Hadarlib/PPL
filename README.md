Principles of programming languages


This course studies principles underlying the design of programming languages. Its main objectives:
Describing program execution by studying evaluators: interpreters, transformers and compilers. 
Comparing programming paradigms: Functional programming, Logic programming and Imperative programming.
Learning principles of program design: Abstraction, contracts, modular architecture, testing.
The course is a mixture of theory and practice. The course interleaves two main threads: (1) learning new programming techniques (functional programming, logic
programming) using practical examples in JavaScript, TypeScript and Prolog; (2) learning meta-programming by developing parsers, interpreters, and program
transformers.
